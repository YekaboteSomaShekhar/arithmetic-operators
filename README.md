### Python project on Arithmetic Operators

This project allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division through user input.

### Code explanation

- Taking two numbers as input from the user using the `input()` function.
- The user is then prompted to enter an operator (+, -, *, or /) to specify the desired operation.
- When the user performs any one operations among them then it will produce desired output based on the `if`, `elif` and `else` conditions.
- If the user enters a invalid operator then it will prints "invalid operator".

### Sample output

- Enter first number: 5
- Enter second number: 3
- Enter operator (+, -, *, /): *
- Result: 15

### Concepts used

- Variables
- conditional statements (if, elif, else)
